For a long time, I want to build my own blog site. Tried wordpress, on my own server. Static html pages with images. But it was costy and kink of waste of time.

Now I found Jekyll, it's really cool way of building personal blog. It brings me new knowledge about Ruby, using markdown files' way of editing blog pages and intresting online editor tool prose.

In the follwing days, I'll try to work out a better style for these pages. Hope the habit of writing blogs helps me improve my written Enlish.

And Hope one day, I can write more technical related articles here.

What's more, if we can build a comment system on this site and counting page views, that would be great.

New hello from 2023.
